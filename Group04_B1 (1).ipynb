The hand of a player has exactly 3 cards. \n",

This variable is a list of lists, so that `hands[i][j]` is defined for $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$, and $j = 0, 1, 2$. You should not assume any particular number of rows for `hands`, but you can assume that it has three columns. `hands[i][j]` is a particular card for player i, which is a string that can be assumed to be one of \"A\", \"2\", ..., \"10\", \"J\", \"Q\", \"K\". \n",

For every card `j` in a hand, its relevant value is added to `handvalue` - we use an if structure to check how many points to add.\n",
